        Over 24,000 eviction filings in The Bronx could go to court beginning next month, when the statewide eviction moratorium ends.</p>

        <p>New York tenants  have been <a href="https://evictionlab.org/eviction-tracking/new-york-ny/">protected</a>  from eviction since Sep 4th, 2020, when a CDC order went into effect. The CDC rule ended on Aug 26th, 2021, but it was replaced by the state’s moratorium on Sep 2nd.  There is no indication that the current moratorium will be extended beyond its expiration on Jan 15th, 2022.   Landlord groups have welcomed its end, saying it hurts them and is unlawful.  However, tenant advocates fear a rush to the courts could drive people to homelessness just as a new wave of COVID-19 hits.</p>

        <p>“It’ll be very scary, especially for The Bronx, where there are high rates of all the indicators that lead to eviction — poverty, unemployment,” said Matthew Tropp, director for housing at Bronx Legal Aid. “It will affect communities of color. It could be devastating.”</p>

        <p>In The  Bronx, over 24,000 eviction cases have been filed since the federal eviction moratorium took effect last year, according to data from <a href="https://evictionlab.org/eviction-tracking/get-the-data/">Eviction Lab</a>. Many of these cases could go to court by late January.  The potential monthly docket is far longer than prior to the pandemic, when Bronx Housing Court typically received 6,000 to 7,000 filings a  month.</p>

        <p>Earlier this year, New York State received $2.1 billion from the federal government to provide grants to struggling renters. However, not everyone applied for the program in time. The state stopped taking most new requests for assistance on Nov 12th. Gov. Kathy Hochul has requested  an additional $1 billion in federal funds for the program,  but as The New York Times recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/14/nyregion/new-york-covid-rent-relief-lawsuit.html">reported</a>, New York is unlikely to get the full request.</p>

        <p>The rental assistance program was never enough to cover the needs in the South Bronx, which has the <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=median%20income&g=0100000US%245000000&tid=ACSST1Y2019.S1901">poorest</a> congressional district in the United States outside of Puerto Rico, says Manny Pardilla, an organizer with the South Bronx Tenants’ Movement.</p>


<p>Many New York landlords are welcoming  the  end  of the moratorium. The Rent Stabilization Association, a city landlord group, has sued the state over the moratorium.</p>

<p>“There is no looming eviction crisis in New York,” Joseph Strasburg, the group’s president, recently <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-rebalance-the-housing-scales-in-new-york-20211204-vveefg4fkvgwxmzgfwcw5bopfy-story.html?fbclid=IwAR2crXi4RTpxNq8Jo6AljRuXBmEX3pr76ia95xx4s4_j0dlf1w65NIm0IV8">wrote</a> in the New York Daily News.</p>
			
<p>Strasburg argued that the city’s right-to-counsel law — which guarantees attorneys for low-income New Yorkers — provides ample protection from eviction.  He noted that prior to the pandemic, only a minority of eviction cases filed by landlords — typically around 9% — resulted in eviction.</p>

<p>However, tenant organizers worry about a rush to the courts. Even if landlords continue to experience  their previous rate of success in court, thousands of families in The Bronx could lose their homes.</p>

<p>According to data from Eviction Lab, The Bronx has more pending eviction filings than any other city borough.  In zip code 10457, which includes Tremont and Mt. Hope, there have been 86 eviction filings per 1,000 rental units since the eviction moratorium began.</p>

</script>

<p>“It’s concerning, and difficult to fathom that these cases are going to forward at the same rate as they  may have pre-pandemic,” said Tropp.  “I’m hoping that the court system  does not deal with them with the same expediency as pre-pandemic.”</p>

<p>Much will depend on how fast cases are calendared in court. The Office of Court Administration says that it is trying to reduce foot-traffic in the courtroom by using  virtual hearings and by scheduling fewer cases in-person.</p>

<p>Evictions are a key driver of homelessness.  The eviction moratoriums helped to significantly reduce the city’s homeless population for the first time in years, as reflected in the number of people staying in shelters run by  the Department of Homeless Services.</p>

</script>

<p>Tropp said that any tenant who receives an eviction notice should take it seriously.</p>

<p>“I think a lot of people still don’t think that they can get evicted, but that’s not  true,” Tropp said. “Get connected with a legal service provider, and file motions in court to stop the eviction from going forward.”</p>
